<p><strong>Technical and administrative measures taken to ensure the security of personal data</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Technical Measures </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use generally accepted standard technologies and operational security methods, including the standard technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL), to protect the personal information collected. However, due to the nature of the Internet, information can be accessed by unauthorized persons over networks without the necessary security measures. We take technical and administrative measures to protect your data from risks such as destruction, loss, tampering, unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access, depending on the current state of technology, the cost of technological implementation, and the nature of the data to be protected. Within this scope, we conclude data security agreements with the service providers we work with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Ensuring Cyber Security:</u> We use the cyber security products to ensure personal data security, but our technical measures are not limited to this. The first line of defense against attacks from environments such as the Internet is established through measures such as firewall and gateway. However, almost every software and hardware is subjected to a number of installation and configuration operations. Considering that some of the commonly used software, especially older versions, may have documented security vulnerabilities, unused software and services are removed from the devices. Therefore, such unused software and services are primarily preferred because of their ease of deletion rather than keeping them up to date. The patch management and software upgrades ensure that the software and hardware work properly and that the security measures taken for the systems are sufficient to check regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Access Restrictions:</u> Access rights to systems containing personal data are restricted and reviewed regularly. Within this scope, employees are granted access rights to the extent necessary for their work and duties and their powers and responsibilities, and access to related systems is provided by using user name and password. When creating these passwords and passwords, combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols are preferred instead of numbers or letter sequences related to personal information that can be easily guessed. Accordingly, the access authorization and control matrix is established.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Encryption:</u> In addition to using strong passwords and passwords, limiting the number of password entry attempts to protect against common attacks such as the use of brute force algorithm (BFA), ensuring that passwords and passwords are changed periodically, and administrator account and admin privileges are opened only for use when needed. and for employees who have been dismissed from the Data controller, access is restricted without delay, such as deleting an account or closing entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Antivirus Software:</u> In order to protect against malware, products such as antivirus, antispam, which regularly scans the information system network and detect hazards are used, and the required files are regularly scanned. If personal data will be obtained from different internet sites and/or mobile application channels, it is ensured that the connections are made via SSL or more secure way.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Monitoring of Personal Data Security:</u> Checking which software and services are operating in information networks, Determining whether there is any infiltration or non-infiltration in IT networks, Keeping the transaction transactions of all users regularly (such as log records), Security problems as fast as possible reporting. A formal reporting procedure is also set up for employees to report security weaknesses in systems and services or threats using them. Evidence is collected and stored securely in the event of undesired events such as information system crash, malicious software, decommissioning attack, missing or incorrect data entry, violations of privacy and integrity, abuse of information system.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Ensuring the Security of Personal Data Environments:</u> If personal data is stored on the devices of the responsible persons or in the media, physical security measures are taken against threats such as theft or loss of these devices and papers. The physical environments containing personal data are protected against external risks (fire, flood, etc.) by appropriate methods and the entrances / exits to these environments are controlled.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If personal data is in electronic form, access between network components can be restricted or separated to prevent personal data security breach. For example, if personal data is being processed in this area by limiting it to a specific portion of the network in use, which is reserved for this purpose, the available resources can be reserved for the security of this limited area, not the entire network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measures at the same level are also taken for paper media, electronic media and devices containing personal data of the Company located outside the Company campus. As a matter of fact, although personal data security violations frequently occur due to theft and loss of devices containing personal data (laptop, mobile phone, flash disk, etc.), personal data to be transmitted by e-mail or mail is also sent carefully and with adequate precautions. Sufficient security measures are also taken in case employees provide access to the information system network with their personal electronic devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of access control authorization and / or encryption methods is applied in case of loss or theft of devices containing personal data. In this context, the password key is stored only in the environment accessible to authorized persons and unauthorized access is prevented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paper documents containing personal data are also stored in a locked and accessible environment only, and unauthorized access to these documents is prevented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any personal data is obtained by others by unlawful means, the Company shall inform the Personal Data Protection Committee and the data subjects of this fact as soon as possible pursuant to article 12 of the Personal Data Protection Law. if they see necessary, the Personal Data Protection Committee may announce this situation at the website or in by any other means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Storage of Personal Data in the Cloud:</u> In the event that personal data is stored in the cloud, it is necessary for the Company to assess whether the security measures taken by the cloud storage service provider are adequate and appropriate. In this context, two-step authentication control is applied for knowing, backing up, synchronizing the personal data stored in the cloud and providing remote access if necessary. During the storage and usage of the personal data in the said systems, it is provided to be encrypted with cryptographic methods, to be encrypted and sent to the cloud environments, and to the use of individual encryption keys where possible for the personal data, in particular for each cloud solution received. When the cloud service relationship ends, all copies of the encryption keys, which may be used to make personal data available, are destroyed. Access to data storage areas with personal data is logged and improper access or access attempts are instantly communicated to those concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Information Technology Systems Procurement, Development and Maintenance</u>: Security requirements are taken into consideration when determining the requirements related to the procurement, development or improvement of new systems by the Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Backing up of Personal Data:</u> In case of personal data being damaged, destroyed, stolen or lost due to any reason, the Company makes use of the backed up data as soon as possible. The backed up personal data is accessible only by the system administrator, and data set backups are excluded from the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Administrative Measures </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All activities carried out by our company have been analyzed in detail in all business units and as a result of this analysis, a process-based personal data processing inventory has been prepared. Risky areas in this inventory are identified and necessary legal and technical measures are taken continuously. (For example, the documents to be prepared within the scope of KVKK have been prepared considering the risks in this inventory)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal data processing activities carried out by our company are audited by information security systems, technical systems and legal methods. Policies and procedures regarding personal data security are determined and regular controls are conducted within this scope.</p>
<ul>
<li>From time to time, our company may provide services from external service providers to meet information technology needs. In this case, we ensure that these Data Processing external service providers meet at least the security measures provided by our Company. In this case, a written agreement is signed with the Data Processor and the contract includes at least the following points:
<ul>
<li>The Data Processor acts only in accordance with the instructions of the Data controller, the purpose and scope of the data processing specified in the agreement, the Personal Data</li>

The first line of defense against attacks from environments such as the Internet is established through measures such as firewall and gateway. However, almost every software and hardware is subjected to a number of installation and configuration operations. Considering that some of the commonly used software, especially older versions, may have documented security vulnerabilities, unused software and services are removed from the devices. Therefore, such unused software and services are primarily preferred because of their ease of deletion rather than keeping them up to date. The patch management and software upgrades ensure that the software and hardware work properly and that the security measures taken for the systems are sufficient to check regularly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cu\u003eAccess Restrictions:\u003c/u\u003e Access rights to systems containing personal data are restricted and reviewed regularly.
