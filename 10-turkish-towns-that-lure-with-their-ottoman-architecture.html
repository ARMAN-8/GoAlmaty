Turkish Towns That Lure With Their Ottoman Architecture</h1><div><p style="text-align: justify;">Architecture and the space it occupies reflect the mindset of time; it provides us a narrative by which we can glimpse into past ways of living, understand aesthetic and functional concerns, and learn about traditions and values. In this respect, they can manifest a panorama for a culture where the very body of the constructed material can incorporate a way to preserve and share temporal norms, acting as a museological source.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here then, we are to present you with unique examples from the Ottoman times that have endured the depredation of time and managed in bringing past to present and communicated us with an invaluable message so that we can go and learn, experience, and enjoy.</p>

Situated on the plains of the Taurus, the traveller here will find delightful sceneries of nature, including plateaus, wild horses running free, and geographical formations such as Altınbeşik cave.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="lazy-container"><div class="lazyload-default"><img style="display:none" data-src="https://cdn.goturkiye.com/goturkey/1200x800-akseki-ibradi-antalya.jpg" /></div><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></div></div><div><p style="text-align: justify;">The houses of Akseki and İbradı are unique in that they are constructed on a bond beam structure where binder materials such as cement or grout are not used, rather stones are supported by these beams. Due to their wooden pointy ends observable even from outside, the locals have come to call them &ldquo;buttoned houses&rdquo;, d&uuml;ğmeli evler.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="lazy-container"><div class="lazyload-default"><img style="display:none" data-src="https://cdn.goturkiye.com/goturkey/1200x800-akseki.jpg" /></div><div class="lazyload-wrapper "><div class="lazyload-placeholder"></div></div></div><div><p style="text-align: justify;">Akseki and İbradı are only 26 km apart from each other. Here, the most remarkable examples of these houses can be found in Sarıhacılar village in Akseki, Ormana and &Uuml;r&uuml;nl&uuml; villages in İbradı; further, some of these houses are open for accommodation, and if you go around in August, you can join the Grape Festival that has been held in the Ormana village for half a century!</p>
